# Control_Net_ReImagen

So during my BTP I took the my topic as the diffusion models. I wasn't that much pro in this topic but I took cause it seems fascinating to me. 
But after I got my research paper Re_Imagen to work on, it became little frustrated as I earlier I wasn't able to find any source code for this paper.
So I have to code it from scratch which I did and trained it on Flickr-31K dataset for 12 days on RTX3090 but still ,I think because of my code or training process.The FID score was around 512 (Worst)

I just heard from youtube about the controlnet architecture , it fascinated me again and I tried to code the Re-Imagen using this architecture. I coded it and gained some better results and it was really
a happy moment for me. I wasn't getting the picture like all current models but I was getting the pictures with boundaries and little bit colour gradients with which we can figure out what is the picture is about.

This was the architecture that I tried to build my model with
